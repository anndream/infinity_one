# <a name="Chapter3-3"></a>Leaving and hiding rooms

When you hover your mouse over a channel listed on the left-hand pane, you will see
two icons appear to the right of the channel name: ![JOIN](/images/ucc-hide.png) 
Hide\_room and Leave\_room.

To hide a room is to remain a member of the channel but to remove it from your
list of channels on the left-hand pane. To leave a room is to no longer be a member
of the channel. Click on the corresponding icon to "hide" or "leave" a room.

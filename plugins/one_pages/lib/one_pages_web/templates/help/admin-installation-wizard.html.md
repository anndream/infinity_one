# <a id="wizard"></a>Installation Wizard

To access Infinity One from a web broswer, enter the IP address or hostname of the UCx Server followed by ' **:4021** '.
For example: http://192.168.1.200:4021

The application does not provision any default user when installed for security reasons. Instead, the first time you visit the site in your browser, you will be taken to an installation wizard.

## Step 1 - Site URL / Host Name

The first page of the wizard allows your to change the host name / IP address that users will use to access the system.

The field will be prepopulated with the IP/host name that you used to get to the wizard. It this is the same IP/Host that you will use, keep the default. 
However, if your are accessing the application for the first time from an internal IP that users will not normally use, then enter a different value here. The value should be the address used to create links in the outgoing email for invitations,  registrations, confirmations, and password resets. 

## Step 2 - Administrator Account

The administration account you complete here does not require confirmation. So, once you have submitted the wizard, you can log in right away using the username and password configured here.

# <a name="Chapter3-2"></a>Joining rooms

You have several options to join a room or channel.

Your channels are listed on the left-hand pane under **CHANNELS(X)**, where X represents
the number of channels you have joined. To view all available channels, click on
the "**More channels...**" link. Click on a channel to preview its contents. If you
want to join it, click on the ![JOIN](/images/ucc-join.png) button.

Clicking on a `#room-name` reference in any posted message will connect to that room in
preview mode. Click on the JOIN button joins the room as described above.

Finally, you can use the join slash command.

    /join #room-name

You can also be invited to a room by someone else. The following options are available
to invite someone to a room:

Create a new room by clicking the `+` button (to the right of the search box) on the
left-side navigation panel. Near the bottom of the form, you can select user's that
will be automatically subscribed to the new room.

Rooms can be marked as `default` by an administrator. When a new user creates an
account on Infinity One, they are automatically subscribed to all the default rooms.

Finally, there are three additional [slash commands](/help/shash-commands) that can
be used for inviting users to a room:

    /invite @user-name
    /invite-all-to #room-name
    /invite-all-from #room-name

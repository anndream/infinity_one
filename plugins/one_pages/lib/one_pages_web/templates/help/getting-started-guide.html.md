# Getting Started with InfinityOne

Welcome to InfinityOne! Like any new tool, mastering InfinityOne will take some time,
but once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you got along without it.

InfinityOne is designed around a few key ideas:

* You spend far more time reading communications than writing them. So InfinityOne
  is designed around consuming messages; either reading them, or making an informed
  decision not to read them.
* Messages in InfinityOne are organized into channels (rooms), which can be of 4 types.
  1. Public rooms are available for any user to view and post.
  2. Private channels are only available to users how have create the channel, and
     those users how have been invited into the channel.
  3. Direct message channels allow users to chat with other users. These channels
     are between two users and are private. No other users can view direct message
     channels, not even system administrator.
  4. N-way channels are similar to direct message channels but allow more than two
     people to communicate privately.
* InfinityOne keeps careful track of which messages you've read, and always places
  you where you left off.

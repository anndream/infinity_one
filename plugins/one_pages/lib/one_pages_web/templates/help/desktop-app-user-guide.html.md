# Using the Desktop Application

The desktop application may provide a better experience than using a browser. The application
has a number of additional features over a web browser:

* Simultaneously connect to multiple InfinityOne servers.
* Stay logged in, and continue to receive notifications, when you close the main window.
* Application badges to easily see when you have outstanding notifications.
* Native desktop notifications.
* Configure the application to automatically start on system startup.
* Remember the window's last position and restore on startup.
* And more options...


## Connecting to a server

When you open the InfinityOne client for the first time, you will come across a screen
asking for your nfinityOne's server address. Enter the host name or IP address provided by your
administer and press the **Connect** button.

   There's no need to add `https://` in the case that your server is running a secure
   HTTP (HTTPS) protocol.

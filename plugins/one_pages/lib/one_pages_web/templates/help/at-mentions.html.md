# @ Mentions

You can "mention" someone by typing @ followed by their username, for example @john. Enter @ and start typing the username, a drop-down list will appear where you can select the desired user.

A user can be selected from the list by clicking on the username or using the keyboard arrow keys to scroll up and down then select by pressing the tab key.

When someone is mentioned in a room, they will get a desktop notification and also a badge count beside the room name if they are not already in the room.
